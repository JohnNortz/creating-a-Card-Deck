recent changes to repository:
 -Added README file
 -Changed card ranks to show Ace, Jack, Queen, King instead of 1, 11, 12, 13 respectively


 Used BDD create tests first and classes in response to tests instead of the other way around.

 Tests should check if cards are generating properly and checking certain cards within a new deck to make sure suits and ranks are generating and incrmenting properly
